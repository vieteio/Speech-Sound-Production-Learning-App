# Recommended First Implementation

I recommend starting with a simplified version of the **Sound Recording & Analysis Process**, focusing on basic audio analysis:

## Simplified Process V1
- **Input**: 
  - User's recorded sound (single phoneme)
  - Pre-recorded target sound
- **Processing**:
  - Basic frequency spectrum analysis
  - Amplitude envelope analysis
- **Output**:
  - Simple similarity score (0-100%)
  - Basic frequency/amplitude graphs

## Extension Plan
1. Add more sophisticated audio analysis:
   - Phoneme-specific feature extraction
   - Multiple comparison metrics
   - Machine learning for pattern recognition

2. Integrate clinical knowledge:
   - Define acceptable ranges for each phoneme
   - Add specific feedback rules
   - Include language/accent variations

3. Add facial recognition:
   - Start with basic lip tracking
   - Add more facial features
   - Integrate with audio analysis

This simplified version provides a technical foundation while deferring the more complex clinical aspects. It can be tested and validated with speech therapists before adding more sophisticated features.

The main technical components (audio recording, basic signal processing) are well-understood, making it a good starting point. The clinical expertise can be gradually incorporated as the system evolves.
