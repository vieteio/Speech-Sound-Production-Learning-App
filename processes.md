# Speech Sound Learning App - Processes and Use Cases

## Core Processes

### 1. Sound Demonstration Process
- **Name**: Visual and Auditory Sound Demonstration
- **Input**:
  - Target phoneme/sound
  - 3D visual demonstration data
  - Audio samples of correct pronunciation
  - Clinical techniques database
- **Output**:
  - Visual demonstration (3D animation)
  - Audio playback
  - Clinical instruction steps
- **Transition Parameters**:
  - Language selection
  - Accent/dialect variation
  - Age-appropriate presentation mode

### 2. Sound Recording & Analysis Process
- **Name**: User Pronunciation Analysis
- **Input**:
  - User's recorded sound
  - Target phoneme parameters
- **Output**:
  - Accuracy score
  - Specific feedback points
  - Improvement suggestions
- **Transition Parameters**:
  - Frequency analysis
  - Amplitude analysis
  - Facial recognition data (optional)
  - Acceptable pronunciation range

### 3. Progress Tracking Process
- **Name**: Learning Progression
- **Input**:
  - User's practice history
  - Success rates
- **Output**:
  - Next difficulty level
  - Practice recommendations
- **Transition Parameters**:
  - Progression rules
  - Difficulty thresholds

## Use Cases

### 1. Basic Sound Learning
1. User selects target sound (e.g., Hebrew 'ר')
2. System demonstrates correct pronunciation → Sound Demonstration Process
3. User records attempt
4. System analyzes recording → Sound Recording & Analysis Process
5. System provides feedback
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until mastery

### 2. Progressive Learning
1. Complete Basic Sound Learning
2. System advances to syllable level → Progress Tracking Process
3. System demonstrates syllable combinations
4. Practice and analysis cycle
5. Advance to word level
6. Continue to more complex utterances

## Questions for Clarification

1. Should the system include real-time feedback during pronunciation attempts, or only post-recording analysis?
2. What specific facial recognition parameters would be most relevant for pronunciation analysis?
3. Should the system include a parent/therapist dashboard for monitoring progress?
4. What range of languages should be initially supported?
5. Should the system include gamification elements in the learning process?
