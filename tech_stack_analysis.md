# Technology Stack Analysis

## Core Requirements (from current specs)
1. Audio recording capability
2. Audio signal processing (frequency/amplitude analysis)
3. Basic visualization of audio data
4. Simple comparison algorithm
5. User interface for recording and feedback

## Critical Questions for Tech Stack Selection

### Deployment Questions
1. Should this be a:
   - Web application
   - Mobile native app
   - Cross-platform mobile app
   - Desktop application
   
2. If mobile:
   - Which platforms need to be supported (iOS/Android/both)?
   - Minimum supported OS versions?

### Performance Requirements
3. Does the analysis need to be:
   - Real-time
   - Near real-time (slight delay acceptable)
   - Post-recording only

4. Where should the audio processing occur:
   - Client-side
   - Server-side
   - Hybrid approach

### Data Management
5. Do we need to:
   - Store recordings locally
   - Upload to cloud
   - Both
   
6. Expected user base size and scaling requirements?

### Development Constraints
7. Development team expertise and preferences?
8. Budget constraints for paid services/libraries?

## Potential Tech Stack Options

Pending answers to above questions, here are potential options:

### Option 1: Web-Based Solution
- Frontend: React/Vue.js with Web Audio API
- Backend: Python (FastAPI/Flask) with librosa/scipy for audio processing
- Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js
- Storage: Local storage + optional cloud storage

### Option 2: Mobile-First Solution
- Framework: React Native or Flutter
- Audio Processing: TensorFlow Lite + custom DSP libraries
- Visualization: React Native Charts or Flutter Charts
- Storage: SQLite + optional cloud sync

### Option 3: Desktop Solution
- Framework: Electron
- Audio Processing: Node.js + Python backend
- Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js
- Storage: Local file system

### Common Components (Any Solution)
- Audio Processing Libraries:
  - librosa (Python)
  - Web Audio API (JavaScript)
  - TensorFlow for future ML integration
  
- Visualization Libraries:
  - D3.js
  - Chart.js
  - plotly

Once we have answers to the critical questions, we can make a more informed decision about the specific tech stack to use.

## Initial Recommendation

Based on the need for rapid prototyping and wide accessibility, I would tentatively recommend Option 1 (Web-Based Solution) with:

1. Frontend:
   - React with TypeScript
   - Web Audio API for recording
   - Chart.js for visualizations

2. Backend:
   - Python FastAPI
   - librosa for audio processing
   - scipy for signal processing

3. Storage:
   - Browser's IndexedDB for local storage
   - Optional cloud storage (to be determined)

This stack provides:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Good performance for audio processing
- Rich ecosystem of audio processing libraries
- Easy deployment and testing
- Scalability options

However, this recommendation might change based on answers to the critical questions above.
